title: Flight Rules

```text
Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals 
that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. 
Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard 
operating procedures.
— Chris Hadfield, An Astronaut's Guide to Life.

这里包含一些不适合作为博文出现的内容，主要是一些教程，比如如何安装某个库，如何使用某些软件，或者怎么处理某些bug。

简单地说：_what to do if X occurs, and why._
